<!--
before you running this app you will need
1. an url api to send mail from the contact form (I used it from another project that I built...)

lets start...
1. change the env-example file name to .env and fill up the fields there.

in the cli
1 run npm install
2 run npm start
3 open your browser in localhost:3000

good luck...
