    "about": "Hi, my name is Meir Stiglitz,
    Full stack developer,
    I always research, understand the code in depth and what goes on behind the scenes,
    In fact, I'm a professional magician, and in this job, because there really is no school to learn it, I always had to teach myself the magic, and practice it over and over again,
    Now that I'm in the dark magic world (CLI and VS CODE ...)
    These are the most important skills I bring with me, super fast and quality self-learning, and endless perseverance"
