    "about": "Hi, my name is Meir Shtiglitz, a Full Stack Developer. \n I research to understand the code in depth and to know wat goes on behind the scenes. \n In fact I'm a professional magician. In this job, because there are no school for it, I had to teach myself the magic, and practice it over and over again. \n Now that I'm in the dark magic world (CLI and VS Code...), Those are the most important skills I bring with me: super-fast and self-learning qualities, and endless perseverance."
